# BuildSteel Providers Web Scraping

This project is a web scraping tool designed to collect data on steel providers listed on specific websites. The script extracts important details such as company names, contact information, and services provided. This data can be utilized for market research, business development, or data analysis.

## Features
- **Automated Scraping**: The script uses Python's `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to automate the data extraction process.
- **Data Export**: The scraped data is structured and saved in a CSV format, making it easy to analyze or import into other tools.
- **Configurable Targets**: The URLs to be scraped can be easily modified in the script to target different providers or websites.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is implemented to manage connection issues and ensure the script runs smoothly.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `requests`
- `BeautifulSoup`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmetdzdrr/buildsteel-providers-web-scraping.git

   cd buildsteel-providers-web-scraping
   ```
3. Run the scraping script:
